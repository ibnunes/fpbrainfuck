This unit provides an interpreter for Brainfuck and regular variants.

It uses only the procedural paradigm, in spite of using the mode objfpc for some particularly useful features.

For a complete definition of "Brainfuck" and "regular variants", refer to the documentation (_to be done_).

For a complete OOP approach, please refer to my friend's repository, Nuno Picado, available at:
  https://github.com/nunopicado/BrainFuckParser

This interpreter fully supports **Morsefuck** (http://esolangs.org/wiki/Morsefuck) and **Bitfuck**.


**How to compile**

Run *fpc brainfuck* using Free Pascal 3.0.0. All units will be compiled automatically.
